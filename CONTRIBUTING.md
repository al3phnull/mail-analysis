# Ruski's awesome contribution guide.

### How do I contribute?

_hint_: you don't.

**No one** contributes to this. Not even the original creator. You are free
to steal this and learn how to do this sort of analysis based on my 
code. 

If you happen to work for Deliveroo as a rider, you may use this without
making any changes simply by downloading a local database with your emails and
loading them into the notebook. (Easy if you rename your mbox file)

If you happen to work for Deliveroo and you're concerned about the 
content of the emails being public, I apologise.

If you happen to work for Deliveroo and are based in the head office,
and wish to offer me a high-paying job, please feel free to contact me
by emailing alexey at tarut dot in.

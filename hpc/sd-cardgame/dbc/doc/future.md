### Future

* There is scope to add a name field, where the bot and player can have names
While not crucial to the game, having the player's name in the game adds a personal element to the game, 
that the user is a player of the game, not just a "Player".
* An early mockup of a graphical user interface was created using Qt4. This could be very doable given the
current code.
Graphical user interfaces are naturally a good option to have for a game. This would give a more 
accurate representation of that the game's design attempts to achieve. It also adds a more intuitive method
of user interaction with the game. It also may add an artistic element to the game, rather than simply
hacking code that runis a CLI game.
* The bot class was made in a hurry. Some of the functions may be migrated to it from the Game class
* The main game and bot functions in Game() are too long and complex. They could be refatored.
